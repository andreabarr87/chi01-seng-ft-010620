# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# names = ["Sally", "Steve", "Samer", "Sloane", "Sid"]
#
# names.each do |name|
#   Farmer.create(name: name)
# end


# cow_names = ["Johann-X", "Firsco-X", "blank-X", "Zilda-X", "Lunk-X"]
#
# 50.times do
#   Cow.create!(farmer_id: 1, spots: 4, name: cow_names.sample)
# end

# p Cow.all.length
